# Usage

Refer to [Simulate Scenario documentation](https://github.com/fortinet-fortisoar/solution-pack-soc-simulator/blob/develop/docs/usage.md) to understand how to simulate and reset scenarios.

To understand the process FortiSOAR follows to manage vulnerabilities, we have included a scenario &mdash; **Vulnerability Management** &mdash; with this solution pack.

Refer to the section *Vulnerability Management* to understand how this solution pack's automation addresses your needs.

## Vulnerability Management

### Scenario

This scenario generates an example asset, scan, and some vulnerabilities.

Navigate to the generated scan and note the following:

The scan contains the following information

- Scan state
- Scan duration
- User's email address
- Asset details as a record

Navigate to the generated asset, within the scan, and note the following:

- Reported Asset contains the following among other information
    - Host Name
    - IP Address
    - MAC Address
    - Operating System
- Select the asset record to view the following information about the reported asset
    - Asset's Operating System
    - Asset's State
    - Asset's Status
    - Asset's Criticality

Navigate to the generated vulnerabilities and note the following about the scanned asset:

- Severity
- Status
- Risk and Risk score
- Exploits
- Exploit Skills

You can open each vulnerability to read Description, Synopsis, and proposed Solution for each.

Users can launch the **Get Vulnerability Details** playbook. This playbook performs the following automated tasks:

- Identifying severity of the vulnerability
- Finding vulnerability count
- Getting synopsis, solution, plugin details, risk information and reference information.


### Critical/High Vulnerability Response 

- On completion of ingestion for a particular scan, a response playbook will be executed
- This playbook fetches the assets associated with scan and checks if the asset is having critical or high vulnerability attached to it 
- an alert will be created for such high-risk assets with alert type `Vulnerable Asset`
- The newly created alert will contain `Vulnerability ID`, `Vulnerability Name` and `Vulnerability Record Link` in the description of the alert
![Alert Description](./res/alert-description.png)
>- In case, if the same asset is found in the next scan with added vulnerabilities, such vulnerabilities will be appended to the existing alert description, also the comment will be added for the same in the alert
> ![Updated Alert Description](./res/updated-alert-description.png)
- A manual input will be created for the alert showing pop-up as below
![Alert Manual Input](./res/vuln-response-manual-input.png)
- Once all the vulnerabilities associated with the asset are resolved, click on the `All Vulnerability Resolved` button
- This will delinks all the vulnerabilities from the asset and closes the alert
