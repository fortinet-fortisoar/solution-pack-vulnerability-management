        "description": "The Exploit Prediction Scoring System (EPSS) is a framework used in cybersecurity to assess the likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited by adversaries. It leverages various factors, such as the characteristics of the vulnerability, its accessibility, and historical data on similar vulnerabilities, to generate a prediction score. The EPSS aids security analysts and organizations in prioritizing their vulnerability management efforts, allowing them to focus on high-risk vulnerabilities that are more likely to be exploited. By using EPSS, organizations can effectively allocate their resources, mitigate potential threats, and enhance their overall security posture.",
